# HELP International Relief Analysis

This project aims to analyze global data to identify countries that are in critical need of relief and medical aid. Conducted for HELP International, an NGO focused on fighting poverty and providing essential services to underserved populations, this analysis supports the organizationâ€™s mission to prioritize countries requiring immediate relief based on key health and economic indicators.


## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

- Analyze global socio-economic and health data to identify countries most in need of relief and medical aid.

- Determine the top 5 countries where relief efforts should be concentrated, using factors like child mortality, GDP per capita, and income.

- Offer actionable insights to HELP International for better targeting of their relief operations.
## Project Workflow

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

       - The dataset includes socio-economic and health metrics such as child mortality, income, and GDP per capita.

       - Preprocessing involved handling outliers, missing values, and normalizing data for consistency.

2. Clustering Analysis:

       - Clustering techniques were employed to group countries with similar health and economic conditions.

       - Clusters were analyzed to identify the ones with the most critical need for relief and medical aid.
3. Visualizations:

       - Visual representations were created to highlight the countries in need, helping HELP International make informed decisions.
       
       - The top 5 countries most in need of relief were visually emphasized.
## Key Metrics Analyzed

- Child Mortality: Countries with the highest child mortality rates are prioritized for relief efforts.
- GDP Per Capita: Used to assess economic capability and need for external support.
- Income: Lower income levels suggest greater need for relief and external aid.
## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and clustering.
- Scikit-learn: Used for K-Means clustering to identify country groups.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualizing data insights.
- Pandas, NumPy: For data processing and analysis.
## Results

The analysis identified several countries with critical needs for relief and medical aid based on child mortality and economic hardship. 

The top 5 countries identified for relief efforts are:

    1. Haiti

    2. Sierra Leone
    
    3. Chad
    
    4. Central African Republic
    
    5. Mali
